# Summary

## Drawback of the new design
- Currently the table only holds information about UFO sightings in US. Once we have more data from other countries the table will be much larger. I would be nice to have a better method for filtering. As of now, in order to know what to filter by user has to scroll in the table to know the filter value. For example user will have to scroll the table to know OR is anoption to filter by in the state.

## Recommendation for improvement
- To fix this filter issue, we can add a drop down to each filter input that the user can click to find all option for that given filter.

- Another recommendation would be to make the table headers static so that where the user scrolls they can always see the table head names.
